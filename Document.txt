A procurement system has been developed for the purchasing department. The intended use
of the system is to allow staff in any department to easily search for a component and view a
list of approved suppliers for that component. Purchasing staff, as administrators of the
system, maintain the list of components, and suppliers.

Currently the system allows us to store a representative name, and representative email for
each supplier - however some suppliers have multiple representatives. We would like the
system to handle multiple representatives and their contact information for a supplier.

* Now, the procurement system handles  multiple representatives and their contact information for a supplier. if we go to Supplier Admin page,
we can see that some suppliers can hold multiple representatives (Many to many relationship) and their information.

* The contact data (Representative's information) can only be maintained by admin staff and to give access only to the user admin to maintain
the data ReadOnlyField has been used. That field does not allow other users to edit/change/delete it other than just viewing it.

* If we go to the source component page, we may now see list of multiple representative information for a supplier.
