For this assignment, models.py, admin.py and supplier_list.html files have been modified.

* Now, the procurement system handles  multiple representatives and their contact information for a supplier. if we go to Supplier Admin page,
we can see that some suppliers can hold multiple representatives (Many to many relationship) and their information.

* The contact data (Representative's information) can only be maintained by admin staff and to give access only to the user admin to maintain
the data ReadOnlyField has been used. That field does not allow other users to edit/change/delete it other than just viewing it.

* If we go to the source component page, we may now see list of multiple representative information for a supplier.
